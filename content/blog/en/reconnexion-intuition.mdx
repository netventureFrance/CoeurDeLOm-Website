# Reconnecting with your intuition

Our intuition guides us toward what is right for us. Here are practical exercises to develop this connection.

## What is intuition?

Intuition is that inner voice that knows, without needing logical proof. It's a form of deep wisdom that connects us to our truth.

## Exercises to develop intuition

### 1. Silent meditation
Take 15 minutes each day to sit in silence and listen to your inner voice.

### 2. Intuitive journaling
Write freely without censorship, let your hand guide your pen.

### 3. Observing signs
Note synchronicities and messages that life sends you.

## Trusting your feelings

Intuition often speaks through the body - sensations, emotions, feelings. Learn to recognize and honor them.

## Conclusion

Developing your intuition is a process that requires patience and practice. Listen to yourself.
